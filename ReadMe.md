## Project Name : **Street Style Landing Page !**

In this project i have created a Street Style landing page from scratch. And i have learnt a lot of things like how to use flex and how css makes life easier , we can manipulate the things in Html with the help of CSS without touching HTML file in terms of positing and direction not in terms of DOM manipulation😅 and i have also learnt about positions mainly in this project.
